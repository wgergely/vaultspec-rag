<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #adr) and one feature tag.
     Replace {feature} with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar]]'.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     Status convention: the H1 status value is one of proposed, accepted,
     rejected, superseded, or deprecated. A new ADR starts as proposed; it
     moves to accepted or rejected when the decision is made; it becomes
     superseded when a later ADR replaces it (set by vault adr supersede,
     which also records superseded_by); and deprecated when it is retired
     without a direct successor.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# `{feature}` adr: `{title}` | (**status:** `{proposed|accepted|rejected|superseded|deprecated}`)

## Problem Statement

<!-- Briefly describe the architectural problem or concern.
Describe why the ADR is being persisted. Is this a new feature? Result of an audit? -->

## Considerations

<!-- Key factors, constraints, requirements. Tech/libraries considered. -->

## Considered options

<!-- Name each alternative evaluated, compared at the same level of abstraction, with its
key pros and cons and why it was kept or rejected. Naming the rejected options - not only
the chosen one - is what lets a future reader reconstruct the decision. Keep each option
to a terse claim-first line or two; the chosen option's full reasoning belongs under
Rationale. -->

## Constraints

<!-- Technical limitations, e.g.: depends on non-mature library, frontier feature, requires rigorous research. 'Frontier' risk, e.g. technology is new and falls outside the implementing model's training cutoff.

List out the blocking constraints, and features, gaps needed for reliable implementation. Must explicitly evaluate how stable 'parent' features are if this adr
relies on another feature. -->

## Implementation

<!-- A high-level overview (not a plan!) of HOW and WHAT will be implemented. Focus on condensed but clear prose that describes functionality layering.

Do not add code; code references must be persisted in a separate `{reference}` document. Important `{reference}` snippets must be summarized and referenced explicitly. -->

## Rationale

<!-- Brief rationale why architecture decision was made. Reference `{research}` findings and grounding `{reference}`. -->

## Consequences

<!-- Gains, but framed honestly. Difficulties. Pathways this feature opens. Pitfalls. -->
