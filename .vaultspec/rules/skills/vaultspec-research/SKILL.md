# Research & Brainstorm Skill (vaultspec-research)

When to use this skill:

- Before implementing non-trivial features.
- When unsure about major design decisions.
- Before refactors with unclear scope.
- Before debugging complex issues.
- When you need user input on design options.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the `vaultspec-research` skill to conduct
structured research and brainstorming."

**Save findings to:** Research artifact at
`.vault/research/yyyy-mm-dd-{feature}-{phase}-research.md`

Load the `vaultspec-adr-researcher` agent persona for focused work. When the
task benefits from multiple researchers, coordinate them through the host
environment rather than assuming a shipped MCP team-thread runtime. Instruct
the researcher to "Conduct research on `{topic}`.
Persist findings to `.vault/research/...`"

## Template

- You MUST read and use the template at `.vaultspec/rules/templates/research.md`.

### Frontmatter & Tagging Mandate

Every document MUST strictly adhere to the following schema:

- **`tags`**: MUST contain **EXACTLY TWO** tags in a YAML list.

  - **Directory Tag**: Exactly `#research`.
  - **Feature Tag**: Exactly one kebab-case `#{feature}` tag.
  - *Syntax:* `tags: ["#research", "#feature"]` (Must be quoted strings in a
    list).

- **`related`**: MUST be a YAML list of quoted `"[[wiki-links]]"`.

  - *Constraint:* No relative paths (`../`), no bare strings, no `@ref`.

- **`date`**: MUST use `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

- **No `feature` key**: Use `tags:` exclusively for feature identification.

## Workflow

- Research & brainstorm might be followed by:
  - User approval -> proceed with `vaultspec-adr` to create and persist ADR.
  - No approval -> prompt user to refine goal/constraints and re-run research.

## Artifact Linking

- Any persisted markdown files must be linked against other persisted
  documents using `[[wiki-links]]`.

- DO NOT use `@ref` style links.

- DO NOT use `[label](path)` style links for internal wiki pages.
