<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# `{feature}` `{phase}` plan

Brief description of the proposed feature, change, or refactor.

## Proposed Changes

Describe what work needs to be done at a high level. Reference `{adr}`s,
`{research}`, `{reference}`, and other plan or reference files where
appropriate so implementation remains grounded in architectural decisions.

## Tasks

Use numbered phases for complex features:

<!-- IMPORTANT: This document must be updated between execution runs to
     track progress. -->

- `{Phase 1}`
  1. `{Step 1.1}`
  1. `{Step 1.2}`
- `{Phase 2}`
  1. `{Step 2.1}`
  1. `{Step 2.2}`

Use tasks for simpler features:

- `{Task 1}`
- `{Task 2}`
- `{Task 3}`

## Parallelization

Brief opinion on how tasks might be parallelized, if at all.

## Verification

Clear mission success criteria. Focus on feature coverage against the original
`{adr}`s and `{research}` documents.

Research and ideate on how to ensure besides unit testing that we have
fulfilled our mission.

Example: "Run unit and integration tests (all pass). However, could not
visually confirm that the feature was functional. Further work is required to
implement features to enable better testing." Be honest - tests can be cheated!
