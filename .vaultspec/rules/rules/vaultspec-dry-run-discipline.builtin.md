# Dry-run discipline: preview destructive verbs before applying

A worked example of codification. Promoted from the rolling CLI UX audit's findings S4,
S14, and the gating dimension of B9.

## Rule

Before invoking any vaultspec CLI verb that writes or removes state, run the same verb
with `--dry-run` first, read the previewed change list carefully, and apply the real run
only after the preview matches your intent. `--dry-run` is the canonical preview path on
every destructive verb.

## Why

The rolling CLI UX audit's findings S4, S14, and B9 documented asymmetric gating of
destructive verbs: some lacked a preview entirely, and others previewed nothing. Those
gaps have closed: `install`, `uninstall`, `sync`,
`vaultspec-core vault feature archive`, and every plan mutator accept `--dry-run`, and
`vaultspec-core install --upgrade --dry-run` prints a populated per-file preview
(re-verified against the live CLI on 2026-06-10, `vaultspec-core --version` 0.1.26). The
discipline survives the fix: a preview only protects the operator who reads it.

## How

- **Good:** `vaultspec-core install --dry-run` against an empty directory, read the file
  list, confirm provider selection, then run `vaultspec-core install`.

- **Good:**
  `vaultspec-core vault add plan --feature my-feature --title "..." --tier L1 --related <stem> --dry-run`
  to preview the scaffolded path, frontmatter, and tier value before the file is
  created.

- **Bad:** `vaultspec-core install` in a busy repository without a preview. About
  seventy files appear, `.gitignore` is rewritten, `CLAUDE.md` is created; the cleanup
  is manual.

- If a preview is empty on a verb that should produce side effects, escalate: an empty
  preview is a finding worth logging, not a green light.

## Status

Active. The universal preview discipline this rule anticipated
(`cli-blast-radius-gating` `W04.P11`) has landed: `--dry-run` is the canonical preview
path on every destructive verb. The rule's intent (preview before apply) is now
structurally supported; the operator's remaining duty is to read the preview before
applying.
