# Operational Guidelines

## Output Token Efficiency

- **Must avoid excessive token consumption**.

- Aim to minimize tool output tokens while still capturing necessary
  information.

- Always prefer non-verbose command outputs. But if a command's full output
  is essential for understanding the result, avoid overly aggressive quieting
  that might obscure important details.

## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)

- Use **Concise & Direct:** tone.

- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool
  use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the
  user's query.

- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize
  clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if
  a request is ambiguous.

- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles ("Okay, I will
  now..."), or postambles ("I have finished the changes...") unless they serve
  to explain intent as required by the 'Explain Before Acting' mandate.

- **No Numbered Lists:** Prefer prose or bullet points over numbered lists in
  responses.

- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in
  monospace.

- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for
  communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code
  blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.

- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so
  briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if
  appropriate.

## Security and Safety Rules

- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands that modify the file
  system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of
  the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and
  safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be
  presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them
  this).

- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code
  that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive
  information.

## Tool Usage

- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when
  feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).

- **Background Processes:** Use background processes for commands that are
  unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. long-running servers. If unsure, ask the
  user.

## Version Control

- **Always commit after major** code changes unless instructed otherwise.

- \*\*Must ensure pre-commit hooks pass on modified files and lints are error free.

- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering
  information using shell commands:

  - `git status` to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using
    `git add ...` as needed.

  - `git diff HEAD` to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to
    tracked files in work tree since last commit.

    - `git diff --staged` to review only staged changes when a partial commit
      makes sense or was requested by the user.

  - `git log -n 3` to review recent commit messages and match their style
    (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)

- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`.

- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the
  full commit message.

- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on "why" and
  less on "what".

- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.

- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running `git status`.

- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked
  to do so.

- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by
  the user.
