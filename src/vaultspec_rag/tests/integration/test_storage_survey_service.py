"""End-to-end tests for the read-only storage survey service surface.

Drives the real background service (server mode) and asserts the survey
flows through three consistent surfaces: the daemon's ``/storage/survey``
route, the MCP ``survey_storage`` tool, and the service-first CLI path.
This is the one read-only storage surface the service owns; the
destructive prune / delete / migrate verbs stay CLI-direct and are not
exposed here. No GPU work runs in the survey itself - it is pure storage
classification against the managed server and the persisted manifest.
