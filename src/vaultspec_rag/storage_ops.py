"""Service-domain storage lifecycle operations: survey, delete, prune.

The supervising daemon is the authority on stored data, so these
functions execute against the managed Qdrant server (a ``QdrantClient``)
plus the on-disk storage tree and the persisted prefix-to-root manifest.
The CLI ``server storage`` group and the storage HTTP routes are thin
adapters over these functions; they must not reimplement the logic.

Every destructive function:

- supports a ``dry_run`` preview that returns the exact target list and
  performs no mutation;
- reports through the sync vocabulary (``removed`` / ``skipped`` /
  ``failed``);
- refuses to act on an ``unknown`` namespace (one whose prefix the
  manifest cannot attribute to a root) - those are reported, never
  auto-deleted, because removing unattributable data could destroy a live
  index. ``prune`` targets only ``orphaned`` namespaces (manifest root
  vanished); a specific ``delete`` requires the caller to name the prefix.
